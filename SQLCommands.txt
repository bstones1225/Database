>4.Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

    . Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?

          .  First and last name - *String*
          .  Whether they sent in their RSVP - *Boolean*
          .  Number of guests. - *Integer*
          .  Number of meals. - *Numeric(4,2)*
    . Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.

	  
           CREATE TABLE dinner (
		first_name string,
		last_name string,
		guests integer,
		meals numeric(4,2)
		);
`
	
    . Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.
	  `ALTER TABLE dinner ADD COLUMN tyCard boolean SET default FALSE;`
        
    . You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.
          `ALTER TABLE dinner DROP COLUMN meals;`
     
    . The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.
          `ALTER TABLE dinner ADD COLUMN tableNum integer;`       


    . The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.
          `ALTER TABLE dinner DROP COLUMN tableNum;`

>5.Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.
          
	  `CREATE TABLE books(
		ISBN integer,
		title string,
		author string,
		genre string,
		pubDate date,
		totalCopies integer,
		availCopies integer
		);
`

    . Find three books and add their information to the table.
	  `INSERT INTO books(ISBN, title, author,genre, pubDate, totalCopies, availCopies)
	   VALUES
	   (0290204895, "Batman:Year One", "Frank Miller", "Comics", 2007/01/10, 30, 30), 
	   (0385199570, "The Stand", "Stephen King", "Science Fiction & Fantasy", 1990/05/01, 20, 20),
	   (1328869334, "1984", "George Orwell", "Fiction", 2017/04/04, 12, 12);
`	  
        
    . Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.
	  `UPDATE books SET availCopies = (availCopies - 1) WHERE ISBN=0290204895;
`
	  
    . Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.
          `DELETE FROM books WHERE ISBN=1328869334;`

>6.Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. In addition to the table creation, provide commands that perform the following operations:
          
	  `CREATE TABLE spacecrafts(
		id integer,
		name string,
		yearLaunched date,
		origin string,
		desc string,
                currentOperate boolean,
		milesEarth float
		);`        


    . Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.
	   
          `INSERT INTO  spacecrafts(id, name, yearLaunched, origin, desc, currentOperate, milesEarth)
	   VALUES
           (001, "Major Tom", 1998/01/01, "USA", "Launch into space", true, 1000.00),
           (002, "HAL", 1975/01/01, "Russia", "Beat Americans into space", true, 2,313,000.00),
           (003, "TARS", 1988/01/01, "Germany", "Give pride to the motherland", true, 342,000.45);

    . Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.
	  
          `DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id=002;`
     
    . Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.
         
          `UPDATE spacecrafts SET currentOperate=false WHERE id=003;`
    

>7.Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. Also provide commands that perform the following operations:
	  
	   `CREATE TABLE email(
		id integer,
		subject string,
		sender string,
		otherRecip string,
		body string,
		time datetime,
		markRead boolean,
                emailChain integer
		);`        
        
    . Add three new emails to the inbox.

	  `INSERT INTO email (id, subject, sender, otherRecip, body, time, markRead, emailChain)
	   VALUES
           (001,"Job Application recieved", "jobs@indeed.com", "", "Job application was submitted and recieved", 2018-11-05 02:34:45, false, 001234),
	   (002,"Did you get that thing I sent ya?", "peterpotamus@harveybirdman.com", "philsebben@harveybirdman.com", "Hey, just wondering if you got that thing I sent ya", 2018-11-08 12:20:45, false, 034256),
           (003,"Promotional opportunity", "someone1@gmail.com", "", "Check out this great promo", 2018-09-05 02:34:45, false, 002234);`

    . You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.
          
          `DELETE FROM emails WWHERE id=002;`
  

    . You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.
	  
          `UPDATE emails SET markRead=false where id=001;`
